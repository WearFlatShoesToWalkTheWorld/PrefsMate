PrefsMate provide an elegant way to generate UITableView. Also, a good care is taken of. 

## Background

In our app, we usually need a UITableView in PrefsViewController(or perhaps named SettingsViewController, whatever). And the interface may just looks like this:

![]()

When implementing this kind of stuff, your inner voice must be saying: "Writing this UI is fxxking tedious! Is there any help that I can find?" 

And here you go! You have come to the right place :).  

## Preparation

All you need is just a plist file containing formatted data.

Taking example of the image above, the formatted plist file looks like this:

![]()
