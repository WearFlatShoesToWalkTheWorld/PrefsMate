PrefsMate provide an elegant way to generate UITableView and take good care of it. 

In our app, we usually need a UITableView in PrefsViewController(or perhaps named SettingsViewController, whatever). And the interface may just looks like this:

![]()

When implementing this kind of stuff, your inner voice says: "Writing this UI is fxxking tedious! Is there any help?" 

And here you go! You have come to the right place :).  

## Preparation
All you need is just a plist file containing formatted data.

Taking example of the image above, the formatted plist file looks like this:

![]()

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements
Swift 4, Xcode 9

## Installation

PrefsMate is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:
